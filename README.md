# WildfireWatch

**WildfireWatch** is an interactive web map that visualizes wildfire perimeter data from 2000 onward. This project utilizes **Leaflet.js** and **GeoJSON** to create a user-friendly, responsive map that displays fire events across different regions. Users can explore historical wildfire data, track fire locations, and better understand the patterns of fire outbreaks over time.

## Features

- **GeoJSON data visualization**: Displays wildfire perimeter data from 2000 onward in an interactive map.
- **Interactive map**: Users can zoom, pan, and explore different regions impacted by wildfires.
- **OpenStreetMap tiles**: Use OpenStreetMap as the base layer for the map for clear and accessible navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Leaflet.js**: Lightweight JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **GeoJSON**: A format for encoding geographic data structures, used to represent wildfire data.
- **HTML & CSS**: Basic web technologies for structuring and styling the map.
